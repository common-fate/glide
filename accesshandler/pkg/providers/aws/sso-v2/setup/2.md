title: Create an IAM role
configFields:

The AWS SSO provider requires permissions to manage your SSO instance.

The following instructions will help you to setup the required IAM Role with a trust relationship that allows only the Granted Approvals Access Handler to assume the role.

This role should be created in your AWS management account. This is the account where AWS SSO is configured and your AWS Organization is managed.

Copy the following YAML and save it as 'granted-access-handler-sso-role.yml'.

We recommend saving this alongside your granted-deployment.yml file in source control.

```yaml
Resources:
  GrantedAccessHandlerSSORole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: "{{ .AccessHandlerExecutionRoleARN }}"
        Version: "2012-10-17"
      Description: This role grants management access to AWS SSO for the Granted Access Handler.
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: AccessHandlerSSOPolicy
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Sid: ReadSSO
                Action:
                  - iam:GetRole
                  - iam:GetSAMLProvider
                  - iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies
                  - iam:ListRolePolicies
                  - identitystore:ListUsers
                  - organizations:DescribeAccount
                  - organizations:DescribeOrganization
                  - organizations:ListAccounts
                  - organizations:ListAccountsForParent
                  - organizations:ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent
                  - organizations:ListRoots
                  - organizations:ListTagsForResource
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentCreationStatus
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentDeletionStatus
                  - sso:DescribePermissionSet
                  - sso:ListAccountAssignments
                  - sso:ListPermissionSets
                  - sso:ListTagsForResource
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
              - Sid: AssignSSO
                Action:
                  - iam:UpdateSAMLProvider
                  - sso:CreateAccountAssignment
                  - sso:DeleteAccountAssignment
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
Outputs:
  RoleARN:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - GrantedAccessHandlerSSORole
        - Arn
```

### Using the AWS CLI

If you have the AWS CLI installed and can deploy cloudformation you can run the following commands to deploy this stack.
Ensure you have credentials for the same account that Granted Approvals is deployed to and that AWS_REGION environment variable is set correctly, we recommend deploying this role to the same region as your Granted Approvals stack.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file granted-access-handler-sso-role.yml --stack-name Granted-Access-Handler-SSO-Role --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once the stack is deployed, you can retrieve the role ARN by running the following command.

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Granted-Access-Handler-SSO-Role --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue"
```

### Using the AWS Console

Open the AWS Console in your organisation's management account and click **Create stack** then select **with new resources (standard)** from the menu.

Upload the template file

![](https://static.commonfate.io/providers/aws/sso/create-stack-with-template.png)

Name the stack 'Granted-Access-Handler-SSO-Role'

![](https://static.commonfate.io/providers/aws/sso/specify-stack-details.png)

Click **Next**

Click **Next**

Acknowledge the IAM role creation check box and click **Create Stack**

Copy the **RoleARN** output from the stack and paste it in the **ssoRoleArn** config value on the right.

### Restricting access to particular Permission Sets

The CloudFormation template above will give the Granted Access Handler access to all Permission Sets in your AWS SSO instance. If you wish to further restrict this, replace the `AssignSSO` policy statement in the CloudFormation YAML with the following:

```
- Sid: AssignSSO
  Action:
    - sso:CreateAccountAssignment
    - sso:DeleteAccountAssignment
    - sso:DescribePermissionSet
    - organizations:DescribeAccount
  Effect: Allow
  Resource:
    - arn:aws:sso:::account/*
    - <SSO_INSTANCE_ARN>
    - <PERMISSION_SET_ARN_1>
    - <PERMISSION_SET_ARN_2>
```

Where:

- `<SSO_INSTANCE_ARN>` is the ARN of your AWS SSO instance from Step 1.
- `<PERMISSION_SET_ARN_1>`, `<PERMISSION_SET_ARN_2>` and so forth are the ARN of the Permission Sets to give Granted Approvals access to.

You can further restrict Granted Approval's access to only provision permission sets in particular accounts. To do so, replace `arn:aws:sso:::account/*` with the ARNs of the specific account IDs you'd like Granted Approvals to access.

### Permitting Access to Assign Permission Sets for the Management Account

The CloudFormation template above will give the Granted Access Handler access to assign users to all accounts in your organization except for the management account.
When the SSO provider create an account assignment, [AWS Service Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) has permission to create a role for the permission set in the account which the user is able to assume. However, this service role does not have permission to create roles in the management account.

If you want to manage access to the management account through GRanted Approvals, add the following statement to the IAM policy cloudformation template:

```
- Sid: AssignManagementAccountSSO
  Action:
    - iam:CreateRole
    - sso:AttachRolePolicy
  Effect: Allow
  Resource: "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-reserved/sso.amazonaws.com/*"
  Condition:
    StringEquals: "aws:PrincipalOrgMasterAccountId":"${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
```

This policy is restricted to creating SSO roles in the management account only and is adapted from the [AWS Service Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) policy.
