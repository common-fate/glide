Your app will be shown in a table of other owned applications in azure. Click on the newly created app and we will now configure some scopes and create an access token.

Next, click on **API permissions** in the tabs on the left hand side. Click on **Add a permission**

Use Application permissions from **Microsoft Graph**

Search for **User** and add: `User.ReadWrite.All`

Then search for **Group** and add: `Group.ReadWrite.All`

Finally search for **GroupMember** and add: `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`

Once you have selected the permissions click **Add permissions** to add them to your application.

Make sure you click **Grant admin consent** above the permissions table and permit the scopes on the application.

Navigate to the **Overview** tab in the Azure portal, and get the first two IDs from the Essentials section.
